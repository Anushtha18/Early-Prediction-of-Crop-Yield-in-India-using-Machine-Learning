# Early Prediction of Crop Yield in India using Machine Learning

The model predicts crop yield by analyzing factors like district (assuming the same weather and soil parameters in a particular district), state, season, and crop type using various supervised machine learning techniques. This helps the farmers to know the crop yield in advance to plan and choose a crop that would give a better yield.
